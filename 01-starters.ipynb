    "Python is very popular programming language in science community, and here are a few reasons why this is the case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatility:** Python is a versatile programming language that can be used for various tasks, including data analysis, simulations, and machine learning. This makes it a useful tool for a wide range of astrophysical applications.\n",
    "- **Large community and resources:** Python has a large community of developers and users, which means there are many resources and libraries available. For example, there are specialized libraries for astrophysicists to analzye spectra, photometric data, interact with astronomical databases throgh API and much more (check out [Astropy Project](https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html) where you can find a list of all supported packages). This saves time and allows us to focus on our research objective rather than reinventing the wheel.\n",
    "- **User-friendly:** Python is relatively easy to learn and use, with a clear syntax and readable code. This makes it accessible to scientists who may not have a background in programming.\n",
    "- **Free and open-source:** Python is free to use and open-source, which means that anyone can use it, modify it, and contribute to its development. This fosters collaboration and innovation within the scientific community."
